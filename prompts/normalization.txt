okay. i have a job to do.

i want to try to normalize the ISPC calculation per dataset instead of looking at it directly. I am going to give you the logic, but i want you to implement it in code.

The logic is:

compute a global mean ISPC value for the entire dataset across the entire time and all electrode. It should be a single value. 

express ISPC value of each stim-segment as a percentage of this mean. Meaning Normalized_ISPC_pre-stim = ISPC_pre-stim / total_mean_ISPC.

Then, instead of looking at the difference between ISPC between stim stages, we compute the percent change based on these normlized values. %Î”=[(Normalized_ISPC_late-stim) - (Normalized_ISPC_pre-stim) / Normalized_ISPC_pre-stim ] * 100

to look at the topographic changes normalize each channel by the total ISPC mean. Z-score each channel within a subject to emphasize deviations from their own typical topography Then compute percent change per channel: This helps you see if some regions change more than others while controlling for individual variability.

this is how i want you to implement it:

have a sub-dir under src named 'normalize'

the process should be independent of the main.m meaning it can be run after initial results already collected. 

there should be one script that loads the .set files and calculates global ISPC value.

there should be another script that deals with the normalized ISPC in time domain.

there should be another one for topographic calculation and visualization

as a reminder, in the project there are multiple subjects with multiple sessions. each session has a dataset, and for each dataset there are multiple protocols. each protocol also known as a stimulation has a corresponding .mat file that has the following strcutre:

Checking file: /Volumes/Ido/analyze/101/N1/output/entrainment_101_N1/stim_1/results.mat

Loading file...

Fields in results.mat:

    {'ispc_results'     }

    {'stim_segments'    }

    {'this_stim_samples'}

ispc_results size: [198 929783]

stim_segments found, contains:

    {'pre_stim'  }

    {'early_stim'}

    {'late_stim' }

    {'post_stim' }

please break this big script into:

topogrpahic calculation
topographic visualization
group average calculation
group average visualization
